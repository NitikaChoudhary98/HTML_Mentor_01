        Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced
        mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the
        summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and
        the other from the north in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet">Tibet</a>. While not
        posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route,
        Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind,
        as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall. As of
        November 2022, 310 people have died on Everest. Over 200 bodies remain
        on the mountain and have not been removed due to the dangerous
        conditions
